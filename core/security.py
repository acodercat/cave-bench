"""Advisory security checker for the Python agent runtime.

CaveAgent solves benchmarks by writing and executing Python, so model-generated
code runs in-process. These static rules restrict the most dangerous operations
before execution. They are defense in depth, NOT a sandbox: a determined agent
can evade any static check, so evaluations should also run inside an OS or
container boundary.

Adapted from air-bench's `core/security.py`, with two deliberate differences:

- `open` is NOT in FORBIDDEN_FUNCTIONS. `FunctionRule` matches on the callee's
  bare name, so it cannot distinguish `open("/etc/passwd")` from `blinds.open()`
  — and the smart-home suite models blinds, windows and doors with an `open()`
  method (`evals/smart_home/types.py`). Including it would fail every smart-home
  scenario on legitimate device control. Reading files is therefore reachable
  here; the container boundary is what closes it.
- The SQL RegexRules are dropped. air-bench validates against live PostgreSQL;
  this repo has no database, so those patterns could only produce false
  positives on ordinary prose or variable names.
