Log every financial transaction (deposits, withdrawals, interest, loans, payments, etc.) to the history. Note: Opening an account is NOT a deposit - only log 'account_opened'. Interest rates are applied directly to the balance (not annualized). When a deposit includes a bonus, log only the final combined amount as one deposit. Reward point redemptions are internal operations - do NOT log them as transactions. All monetary amounts should be integers (truncate decimals, e.g., 20% of 1105 = 221).",
