First, check the office temperature sensor - if it's below 20°C or above 25°C, set the thermostat to 22°C for comfort. Turn on the office light to 80% brightness for productivity. Open the office blinds to 70% to let in natural light but reduce glare. Turn on the office smart plug (connected to my monitor) so my workstation powers up. Enable do-not-disturb on the doorbell so I'm not interrupted. Make sure the robot vacuum is docked and NOT cleaning during work hours.",
