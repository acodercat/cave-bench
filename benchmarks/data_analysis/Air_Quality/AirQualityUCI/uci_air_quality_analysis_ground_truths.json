    "requirements": "You are a Senior Environmental Data Scientist.\n\nANALYSIS SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline:\n   - Structure: Remove columns with missing names and rows with missing Date/Time\n   - Anomalies: Treat value '-200' as missing data (NaN)\n   - Imputation: Fill missing sensor values using Linear Interpolation\n\n2. Diurnal Cycle Analysis:\n   - Target: 'CO(GT)' (True Hourly CO)\n   - Aggregation: Average concentration per hour of the day (0-23)\n\n3. Seasonal Variability:\n   - Target: 'NOx(GT)'\n   - Seasons:\n     * Winter: Months 12, 1, 2\n     * Summer: Months 6, 7, 8\n   - Metric: Average concentration per season\n\n4. Meteorological Correlation:\n   - Method: Pearson Correlation Coefficient\n   - Variables: Temperature ('T') vs Tin Oxide Sensor response ('PT08.S1(CO)')\n\n5. Dominant Trend Identification (PCA):\n   - Features: All numeric sensor/pollutant columns (Exclude metadata, T, RH, and AH)\n   - Normalization: Standardize data (Mean=0, Std=1)\n   - Goal: Identify the feature name with the highest absolute loading on the First Principal Component (PC1)",
