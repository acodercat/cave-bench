Pollution Transport (Dry Haze):\n   - Event: 'Dry Haze' defined as Visibility < 8000m AND Humidity < 80%\n   - Seasons:\n     * Winter Monsoon: Wind Direction 315°-360° or 0°-45°\n     * Summer Monsoon: Wind Direction 135°-225°\n   - Metric: Ratio = Probability(Winter) / Probability(Summer)\n\n2. Urban Heat Island (UHI) Intensity:\n   - Scope: Nighttime hours only (20:00 to 05:59)\n   - Metric: Difference between the Max Station Average Temp and Min Station Average Temp\n\n3. Turbulence Profiling:\n   - Metric: 'Gust Factor' = Wind Gust / Wind Speed\n   - Condition: Valid only where Wind Speed > 10 km/h\n   - Goal: Identify Station Name with highest average Gust Factor\n\n4. Topographic Lapse Rate:\n   - Analysis: Linear relationship between Station Altitude and Yearly Average Temperature\n   - Metrics: Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Regression Slope\n\n5. Extreme Heat Stress:\n   - Event: Single observation where Temp > 33°C AND Humidity > 75%\n   - Aggregation: Sum of events across all stations per day\n   - Goal: Date with the maximum daily count",
