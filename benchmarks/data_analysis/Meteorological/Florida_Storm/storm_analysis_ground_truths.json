Glass Jaw Analysis:\n   - Event: 'Thunderstorm Wind'\n   - Condition: Magnitude < 50 knots\n   - Significance: Count >= 2\n   - Metric: Average Property Damage\n\n2. Temporal Analysis:\n   - Event: 'Flash Flood' with Damage > 0\n   - Calculation: END_TIME - BEGIN_TIME\n   - Unit: Minutes\n\n3. Pareto Distribution:\n   - Scope: Events with Damage > 0\n   - Goal: % of top events needed to reach 80% of total sum\n   - Method: Round up to the next integer number of events if the 80% threshold falls between events\n   - Calculation: (number of events needed / total events with damage > 0) * 100\n\n4. Intensity Comparison:\n   - Targets: 'Tropical Storm' vs 'Hurricane (Typhoon)'\n   - Metric: Average Property Damage\n   - Ratio: Hurricane Avg / TS Avg\n\n5. Risk Scoring (Damped Mean):\n   - Formula: (Total Casualties + alpha * Global Mean) / (Count + alpha)\n   - Casualties: Direct Deaths + Direct Injuries\n   - Global Mean: All Casualties / All Events count\n   - Alpha: 10",
