Tropical storm force winds also led to power outages in the Florida Big Bend and South-Central Georgia. There were two direct fatalities from trees falling on homes in Dixie County, Florida and Moultrie, Georgia. Two indirect fatalities also occurred in Dixie County due to a traffic accident. The highest water marks measured by a survey team from FDEM were around 3 feet AGL in Horseshoe Beach. The University of Florida estimated that agriculture losses across Florida were between $93.7 million and $263.2 million, including crops, livestock, aquaculture, and animal products.",176

Up to 10 inches of flooding was noted in the housing area, and up to 4 inches of flooding in the Maintenance Yard.","The center of Hurricane Helene passed about 200 miles west of Naples as a Category 3 hurricane moving N-NE over the eastern Gulf of Mexico around midday on Thursday, September 26th, then made landfall later that evening in the Florida Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and lowest central pressure of 938 mb. The large wind field around Helene brought tropical storm force winds to a good portion of southern Florida, with the most consistent area of sustained tropical storm force winds over western Collier County on September 26th. Brief but strong tropical storm force wind gusts affected the remainder of southern Florida. Some of the strong wind gusts associated with Helene were not directly associated with rainbands, but due to the very strong pressure gradient and daytime heating which acted to mix down strong winds just above the surface. Most locations experienced some wind damage, primarily to trees. Sections of Collier County observed minor roof and structural damage from wind. ||Significant coastal flooding occurred along the Collier County coast from storm surge.|The first flooding episode, of up to moderate levels, occurred with the high tide on the morning and midday of September 26th when the initial storm surge from Helene reached the area. The subsequent low tide was muted by increasing surge from the major hurricane, with the highest and most impactful flooding occurring during the evening/night high tide cycle of September 26th and early morning of September 27th.|Tide levels reached 4.02 ft above Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) at Naples Bay near the city dock, and NWS storm surveys indicated an 3-4 feet above ground in beachfront locations in Naples, and 1-3 feet above ground in Marco Island, Goodland, Everglades City, and Chokoloskee. Storm surge flooding mainly affected streets and parking lots, but several structures near and along the coast had minor to moderate water intrusion. ||Two EF-0 tornadoes impacted Collier County with very minor damage.||The total effects of Helene in South Florida resulted in about $1.3 million in damage, almost entirely from storm surge flooding in coastal Collier County.",496
