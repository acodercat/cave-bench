Food Environment (Food Swamp Index):\n   - Metric: Count(Fast Food) / (Count(Fast Food) + Count(Supermarket))\n   - Scope: Aggregated by District\n   - Goal: Identify District with the highest Index value\n\n2. Urban Vitality (Functional Diversity):\n   - Target Area: 'Central and Western' district\n   - Metric: Shannon Entropy of the POI 'category' distribution\n\n3. Spatial Dispersion (Clustering):\n   - Target Category: 'cafe'\n   - Metric: Average Nearest Neighbor Distance (Euclidean distance to the closest *other* cafe)\n\n4. Business Intensity (Competitive Nodes):\n   - Metric: Count of *same-category* POIs within a 0.005 degree radius\n   - Goal: Identify the single POI ID with the highest neighbor count\n\n5. Vulnerability Assessment (School Exposure):\n   - Target: Schools exposed to 'fast_food' POIs\n   - Radius: 0.005 degrees\n   - Scoring: Sum of Inverse Distances (1 / distance_in_meters) to all fast food spots within radius\n   - Goal: Identify School with highest Exposure Score",
